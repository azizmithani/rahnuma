<br/>
<b>Task:</b> To identify possible pathways from L-Glutamate to the TCA Cycle in <i>Escherichia coli</i> 
K12.
<p><b>Steps: </b>The steps required to submit the job are as follows.</p>
<i>Main Page</i>

<ol>
  <li>Specify a job name, e.g. &quot;Pathways from Glutamate to the TCA cycle in <i>
  E. coli</i>&quot;.</li>
  <li>Specify a valid email address to get an email notification once the job is 
  finished.</li>
  <li>Select &quot;Pathway Analysis&quot; as the Analysis.</li>
  <li>We would like to predict the pathways between metabolites, so select 
  &quot;Pathway prediction&quot; as Analysis Type.</li>
  <li>Select &quot;Organism&quot; as Analysis Mode as we want to perform analysis on an 
  organism rather than on a phylogeny.</li>
  <li>Network Mode is useful when performing analysis on multiple organisms. It 
  specifies if the organisms should be treated individually or combined to build 
  one single network. Let the default option &quot;Individual&quot; selected.</li>
  <li>Select the desired output type, tabulated or descriptive.</li>
  <li>Select the desired output format, text or HTML.</li>
  <li>Click &quot;Next&quot; to go to the parameters page.</li>
</ol>

<p><i>Parameters Page</i></p>

<ol>
  <li>To select an organism, click &quot;Select&quot;.</li>
  <li>Scroll down the organism list to find the required organism.</li>
  <li>Select &quot;Amino Acid&quot; as subset if not already shown. </li>
  <li>Select &quot;L-Glutamate&quot; as Start Metabolite.</li>
  <li>To select the TCA cycle compounds as end metabolites, change the subset to 
  &quot;TCA Cycle&quot;.</li>
  <li>Select all the TCA cycle compounds. To do this, click the first compound 
  and then while holding the Shift key click on the last compound.</li>
  <li>Choose the required pathway prediction mode. To use the manually annotated 
  connections, use the &quot;Connection&quot; mode.</li>
  <li>Since we would like to trace the pathway to the TCA cycle, select &quot;Carbon 
  Connections&quot; as Connection Option.</li>
  <li>Specify the cutoff length for the pathways.</li>
  <li>Select &quot;Pathway&quot; from the Return Value since we would like a list of 
  predicted pathways. To get a list of the reactions only which are involved in 
  the pathway select &quot;Reaction&quot; as Return Value.</li>
  <li>Click &quot;Submit&quot; to submit the job.</li>
</ol>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; A sample screenshot of the parameters page is shown below.</p>

<p align="center"><img border="0" src="T01_02.jpg" width="919" height="845"></p>

<p><b>Tip:</b> You can click on <b>[?]</b> at anytime to go to the corresponding 
section on the help page.</p>

<p><b>Output: </b>A sample output is shown below.</p>

<p align="center"><img border="0" src="T01_03.jpg" width="935" height="742"></p>

<ol>
  <li> The header part of the result file shows the parameter values 
selected while submitting the job. It also shows the pathway prediction 
parameters, i.e. cutoff length, start and end metabolites.</li>
  <li>Results for pathway prediction are shown in a tabulated format 
(Tabulated Output was selected as Output Type) with following columns.
  <ol type="a">
    <li>Start Metabolite</li>
    <li>Network</li>
    <li>Pathway Length</li>
    <li>Pathway</li>
  </ol>
  For descriptive output, the results are grouped by Network and then by Start Metabolites.
  </li>
  <li>For HTML output, as in this case, entries are hot-linked to 
corresponding entries in KEGG.</li>
</ol>
