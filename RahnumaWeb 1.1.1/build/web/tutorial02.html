<br/>
<b>Task:</b> To identify reactions present in <i>Xylella fastidiosa</i> 9a5c 
that are absent from all <i>Xanthomonas</i>.
<p><b>Steps: </b>The steps required to submit the job are as follows.</p>
<i>Main Page</i>

<ol>
  <li>Specify a job name, e.g. &quot;<i>X. fastidiosa</i> 9a5c versus <i>
  Xanthomonas</i> - reactions&quot;.</li>
  <li>Specify a valid email address to get an email notification once the job is 
  finished.</li>
  <li>Select &quot;Comparative Analysis&quot; as the analysis to be performed.</li>
  <li>Select &quot;Standard Comparison&quot; as the Analysis Type since we want to compare 
  an organism against a group of organisms instead of performing comparison 
  within a group of organisms.</li>
  <li>Select &quot;Organism&quot; as Analysis Mode as we want to perform analysis on 
  sets of organism rather than on a phylogeny.</li>
  <li>We would like to identify reactions that are different, i.e. compare the 
  networks without considering pathways between metabolites, so select 
  &quot;Full Network&quot; as Comparison Mode.</li>
  <li>Select the desired output type, tabulated or descriptive.</li>
  <li>Select the desired output format, text or HTML.</li>
  <li>Click &quot;Next&quot; to go to the parameters page.</li>
</ol>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A sample screenshot is shown below.</p>

<p><i>Parameters Page</i></p>

<ol>
  <li>To select organism 1, click &quot;Select&quot;.</li>
  <li>Scroll down the organism list to find the required organism, &quot;<i>Xylella 
  fastidiosa</i> 9a5c&quot; in this case.</li>
  <li>Similarly, select organisms for the second set. We would like to select 
  all <i>Xanthomonas</i> to form the second set so click the first <i>
  Xanthomonas </i>species and then while holding the Shift key click on the last
  <i>Xanthomonas</i> species.</li>
  <li>Since we want to identify reactions that are missing from all <i>
  Xanthomonas</i> species, i.e. not present in any of the species, we need to 
  build a network that contains all reactions that are present in at least one 
  of the species. To do this, select &quot;All Reactions&quot; as the Mode. 
  Detailed explanation of the organism mode is presented 
<a href="helpoutput.html#OrganismModeInterpretation">here</a>.</li>
  <li>Click &quot;Submit&quot; to submit the job.</li>
</ol>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; A sample screenshot of the parameters page is shown below.</p>

<p align="center"><img border="0" src="T02_02.jpg"></p>

<p><b>Tip:</b> You can click on <b>[?]</b> at anytime to go to the corresponding 
section on the help page.</p>

<p><b>Output: </b>A sample output is shown below.</p>

<p align="center"><img border="0" src="T02_03.jpg"></p>

<ol>
  <li> The header part of the result file shows the parameter values selected 
  while submitting the job. </li>
  <li>Results for comparative analysis are shown in a tabulated format 
(Tabulated Output was selected as Output Type) with following columns.
  <ol type="a">
    <li>Reaction Id (from KEGG)</li>
    <li>Reaction Description</li>
    <li>Network 1</li>
    <li>Network 2</li>
  </ol>
  For descriptive output, the results are grouped according to their presence in 
  a network. 
  </li>
  <li>For HTML output, as in this case, entries are hot-linked to 
corresponding entries in KEGG.</li>
</ol>

<p><b>Note: </b>The interpretation of output for different combinations of organism 
mode for comparative analysis can be found
